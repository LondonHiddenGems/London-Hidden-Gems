     <h3>the mayor scaredy cat</h3>
     <!--insert images and vid-->
     <p>Part of the trend for â€˜secretâ€™ speakeasies, this one is a basement bar beneath the Spitalfields branch of the Breakfast Club. The entrance is the one that looks like a big Smeg fridge door. Go inside and youâ€™ll find a quirky, dimly lit cocktail bar clad in exposed brick and wood: itâ€™s all a bit like a cabin from 'Twin Peaks'. The drinks menu makes an amusing mockery of more self-conscious â€˜undergroundâ€™ venues. The cocktailsâ€“ classics and house specials â€“ are well crafted on the whole.</p>
